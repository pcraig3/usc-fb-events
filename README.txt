Plugin gets events from Facebook and lists them same as clubs.  Backend menu and super-cool caching.

== Description ==

Plugin gets events from Facebook and lists them same as clubs.  Backend menu and super-cool caching.
Expects the Admin Page Framework Demo plugin is installed.  Doesn't work without it.

List of features:

*   api connection to facebook events.
*   shortcodes can generate a list of facebook events.
*   creates a backend menu so that facebook events can be modified or removed from the front-end.
*   possible to add a ticket link to events
*   interfaces with Stephen Harris' Event Organiser plugin to display facebook events on the calendar
*   event-categories and their associated colours carry through to Facebook events
*   also creates mobile view for event-organiser fullcalendar

*Note* plugin is (unfortunately) tied to bespoke USC Facebook events API, so not portable.

== Installation ==

Like normal.  I'll send you a ZIP file and everything should work.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't it work yet. =

It does!

= Really? =

Yes!  It works great.


== Changelog ==

= 1.1.6 =
* Updated bower dependencies
* classlist.js -> classList.js

= 1.1.5 =
* Replaced references to 'testwestern.com' with references to 'westernusc.ca'
* * Everything should work for any site this is installed on, as westernusc.ca/testwestern.com are just API links with return identical data.
* Replaced link in the Plugins settings page for the api
* Also swapped out my 'decodeHtmlEnt' function for another one that works on more servers.

= 1.1.4 =
* Tried to debug stuff but mostly just messed up stuff.  Reverted to 1.1.3 afterwards.

= 1.1.3 =
* AM/PM string on front page events widget was brittle, so I cleaned it up.
* Removed console.logs, because they were unprofessional (and I am not :P)
* Ugly JS fix removes 'readonly' values so that Facebook Events can again be modified

= 1.1.2 =
* Shortcode 'calendars' parameter now supports plus signs (for spaces)
* Events List generated by shortcode has no title if 'title' parameter is empty string
* API call looks for intval of passed-in limit

= 1.1.1 =
* Like a million comments
* Added a small filter for a facebook event description word limit
* Oh yeah, changed it from a character limit to a word limit because that made more sense
* Default start timestamp in WP_AJAX is now 6 months ago instead of being a static value
* Added a link to the Facebook events API (needs to be redone once the server has moved)

= 1.1.0 =
* PRETTY WELL DONE NOW.  LIKE, ACTUALLY.
* * Used JS hook to update WordPress transient cache with our Facebook events in a way I'm really proud of.
* * Created a whole mobile events list thing that took forever.  Hint: this is really impressive.
* * Got the loading horse into the calendar: moo.
* * Did proper loads of commenting
* * Updated the CSS for the fullcalendar.  Sharpened all of the edges.

* * Also possible to count backend events

= 1.0.0 =
* ALMOST DONE

* * Frontpage widget accepts DateInterval arguments, which makes sense.
* * came up with a color for Events
* * Timezones sh*t
* * event-organiser categories control the calendars from which to pull FB events
* * Found a JS hook.  Potentially we could create a mobile view for the fullcalendar.
* * Changed the way that the JS module works: added more modules.
* * Added and then removed the Event sidebar.  I don't think we need it.
* * FIXED THE HTML CODED COMMAS THAT NOBODY LIKES ANYWAY.

* Changing the name of the plugin.


= 0.9.8 =
* Huge update.  Revolutionized the API calling.
* Now calling the same URL as the calendar on the old site (wasn't the same before)
* Can now pass limits and calendars through our plugins to the API so as to reduce post-processing of data

* Caching works in a way I'm pretty happy with

= 0.9.7 =
* Using the HTTP API now instead of cURL

= 0.9.5 =
* Ajax widget now respects limits, some of the date formatting has been improved, and we're on a horse.
